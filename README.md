Each problem will be a function to write. 

Remember that you can execute just the code between the #%% signs by clicking
somewhere in that space and then using Ctrl-Enter (Cmd-Return on a Mac). An
alternative is to use the second toolbar green triangle or Menu>Run>Run cell.

On loops especially, you can make an error that causes the program to run
forever. If you don't get immediate response, then this is probably happening.
In that case, try Ctrl-C. If that doesn't stop it, click your IPython console
away and open a new one from the Consoles menu. Look over your code and see 
why the termination condition can't be met and fix it. Then run again.

You can submit your work in two ways. One is simply to upload this file. This
is the easiest way to go provided that you haven't corrupted it.  To make sure
that it isn't corrupted, run the whole file by clicking the left green triangle
above.  If it is corrupted, you can fix it or submit just your function as 
described next.
To submit only a single function, copy the material between the two #%% into
a text file using this Spyder editor (Choose menu File>New File... to get a 
new file and then copy your function from between the #%%'s. Don't use a word 
processor, but you can use a text editor such as Notepad in Windows or TextEdit 
on the Mac. Save your new file as problemx.py (where x is the problem number). 
Upload this file to Coursera.  Note that the grading program is going to run 
the function with the name specified, so don't change the function name (it 
doesn't matter what you name the file itself).

Note: each of the functions below is made runnable by adding the statement
pass.  This is a do-nothing statement.  You should replace it with your code,
but its present doesn't affect how your code runs.
